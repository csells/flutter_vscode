/// Runs the CI workflow's own steps in a runner-like Linux container.
///
/// The steps are read out of `.github/workflows/test.yml` rather than
/// restated here: a second copy of the commands is a second copy to forget,
/// and this repository has already paid for that lesson once. Whatever CI
/// runs is what this runs.
///
/// `uses:` steps have no command to execute. `actions/checkout` is stood in
/// for by the clone below and `subosito/flutter-action` by the image, which
/// is the only place this test approximates rather than reproduces.
///
/// What it proves: the workflow's commands succeed on Linux, from a clean
/// clone, with the paths, working directories, and nested Docker that CI
/// will use. What it does not prove: x86 behaviour. GitHub's runners are
/// x86_64 and this runs at the host's architecture, because emulating
/// Electron and xvfb is slow enough to make the test useless as a check.
///
/// This test must never run inside the workflow it executes. The gate job
/// runs `test_all.sh`, which runs `flutter test`, so that script excludes
/// the `gate` tag -- without it, the workflow test invokes itself.
