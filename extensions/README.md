# Shipped Example Extensions

Real, installable VS Code extensions built with `flutter_vscode`. They
are product surfaces: each one is expected to work, ship, and stay
honest about what the framework can do today.

## Guardrails

Every extension here consumes the framework the way an Extension
Author would:

- scaffolded and built only with the `flutter_vscode` CLI
  (`create`/`build`/`package`);
- no imports from the repository's internals (`package:flutter_vscode/src/`),
  `tool/`, or test fixtures — only CLI-generated files and the published
  package surface (`package:flutter_vscode/vscode_dart.dart` in hosts,
  `package:flutter_vscode/view.dart` in views);
- when an extension needs something the framework lacks, the gap is
  recorded (futures or a plan) and the framework change lands with its
  own tests first; the extension then consumes it like any author.

These directories are excluded from the pub package archive.

## coverage_treemap

Line coverage from `coverage/lcov.info` painted into the editor, a
status-bar coverage percentage, and an interactive squarified coverage
treemap rendered by a Flutter View.

Build and run it:

```sh
cd extensions/coverage_treemap
flutter_vscode build
```

Open `extensions/coverage_treemap` in VS Code and press F5 — or launch
the Extension Development Host directly from a terminal against any
project that has coverage data:

```sh
code --new-window \
  --extensionDevelopmentPath="$(pwd)/extensions/coverage_treemap" \
  /path/to/a/project/with/coverage
```

In the development host, open a workspace containing
`coverage/lcov.info` (run `flutter test --coverage` in any Flutter
project first), then:

- covered and uncovered lines are highlighted in the active editor;
- the status bar shows the overall percentage — click it (or run
  **Coverage: Run Tests with Coverage**) to run `flutter test
  --coverage` in a VS Code terminal and refresh everything from the
  new numbers, no external CLI session needed;
- **Coverage: Show Treemap** opens the Flutter treemap panel, which
  renders its summary charts with the pub.dev package `fl_chart` —
  Flutter-ecosystem code reuse running inside VS Code;
- **Coverage: Refresh** and **Coverage: Toggle Line Highlights** do
  what they say;
- editing or regenerating `lcov.info` refreshes automatically.

Note: the Dart extension's Testing-UI "Run with Coverage" feeds
VS Code's native Test Coverage API and does not write
`coverage/lcov.info`; use the status-bar action (or any
`flutter test --coverage` run) to update this extension's data.

The real-host gate for this extension is
`scripts/test_coverage_extension.sh`: it packages the VSIX, installs
it into the pinned Extension Host in Docker, opens a workspace with a
known tracefile, and asserts both the parsed snapshot and that the
Flutter View boots and serves the snapshot operation over the view
protocol in a real webview.

`flutter_vscode package` writes the installable VSIX under `build/`.

## pubspec_lens

Dependency intelligence for `pubspec.yaml`, and the first Host-Only
Extension: no Flutter View, no webview — the whole UX rides VS Code's
native UI surface, driven from plain Dart through the generated
layer. Hover a dependency for the latest version and description;
any pin whose lower bound trails the registry gets a CodeLens that
rewrites the constraint through a `WorkspaceEdit`, and the pins that
actually *block* the latest release also get an Information-severity
diagnostic; a dependencies tree view lists direct dependencies with
verdicts; a refresh command re-queries. The semantics come from the
Dart team's own packages — `pub_semver` for constraint math and
`yaml` for
span-preserving parsing — and the registry is fetched with the
generated runtime's `hostFetch`, with the base URL configurable so
the real-host gate serves a deterministic fake pub.dev.

The dividing line the two examples draw together: use the native
surface (trees, pickers, hovers, lenses, squiggles, status bar) when
your UX is lists, text, and annotations; reach for a Flutter View
only when you need custom drawing, like the treemap.

Build and run it:

```sh
cd extensions/pubspec_lens
flutter_vscode build
```

Open `extensions/pubspec_lens` in VS Code and press F5 — or launch
the Extension Development Host from a terminal against any Dart
project:

```sh
code --new-window \
  --extensionDevelopmentPath="$(pwd)/extensions/pubspec_lens" \
  /path/to/any/dart/project
```

In the development host, open `pubspec.yaml` (analysis runs on open
and queries the registry — live pub.dev by default — so give the
first pass a second or two). Any pin below the latest release is
enough to see it work; age one to a previous major (say
`http: ^0.13.0`) to see both tiers at once:

- a CodeLens above every trailing pin offers **Update to ^X.Y.Z**;
  clicking it rewrites the constraint through a `WorkspaceEdit`, so
  the edit lands in your buffer (the file goes dirty), never
  silently on disk;
- the pins that actually *block* the latest release — where the
  constraint excludes it, so `pub get` can never resolve to it — also
  get an Information-severity squiggle, and the Problems panel reads
  `http 1.6.0 is available (pinned ^0.13.0)`. Severity is Information
  by design: a newer release is advice, not a defect;
- a pin that merely trails the latest inside its caret
  (`http: ^1.5.0` when 1.6.0 is out) gets the lens but no squiggle —
  nothing is broken, so the Problems panel stays about real blockers;
- a pin already at the latest version is silent on every surface;
- hover a dependency name for the latest version, the verdict, and
  the package's pub.dev description;
- **Pubspec Lens: Refresh** clears the registry cache and
  re-analyzes — useful after hand-editing a constraint;
- offline, verdicts degrade to *unknown* with no diagnostic churn,
  and recover on the next refresh.

Constraints that sit *ahead* of the registry (a lagging mirror, a
prerelease pin) are never "fixed" by a rewrite that walks them
backwards: the comparison is against the constraint's lower bound,
so there is nothing to suggest.

The real-host gate is `scripts/test_pubspec_lens.sh`: it packages
the VSIX, installs it into the pinned Extension Host in Docker,
serves a deterministic fake pub.dev from inside the host, and
asserts the hover, the single diagnostic, a lens on each trailing
pin (and none on the current one), both CodeLens edits, and the tree
snapshot. First-cut note: the dependencies tree view renders only
where its view id is contributed (the gate's driver does this, so it
won't appear in a plain F5 session); manifest views/configuration
contributions are a recorded framework follow-up.

Plan and status:
[`specs/plans/pubspec-lens.md`](../specs/plans/archive/pubspec-lens.md),
then [`specs/plans/lens-verdicts.md`](../specs/plans/archive/lens-verdicts.md)
for the two-tier verdict rule.
